in app/page.tsx :

initial SSR should happen then only CSR ,that is why we use isMounted variable 
in nextjs initially SSR happens then by hydration CSR happens, so during SSR if CSR happens by any component hydration mismatch happens and we get errorso to avoid this we use isMounted variable to check if the component is mounted or not, if not then return null so that no hydration mismatch happens

on  initial mounting of page , useEffect doesnt run , it only runs in the first render that is the render after the initial mounting of page(initial render where SSR happens).

1. Component Lifecycle in Next.js:
   - Initial mounting and first render happen together (SSR phase)
   - Then useEffect runs after this first render
   - Then CSR begins through hydration

2. isMounted Pattern:
   - During SSR: isMounted is false, returns null
   - After first render: useEffect runs
   - useEffect sets isMounted to true
   - Component re-renders with actual content (CSR phase)

4. Flow:
   Initial Mount/First Render (SSR) → useEffect → Set isMounted → Re-render (CSR)
   └─ return null                   └─ runs     └─ true        └─ actual content
